# Code->Review->Merge->Repeate

Welcome to Code->Review->Merge->Repeate (CRMR for short) public repo. This is a general grab-bag of things that I have written over the years for Salesforce that might be useful for other Salesforce developers. Scripts, aura components, LWCs, classes and triggers and all other manner of code to expand basic Salesforce functionality that I've accumulated over the years of working in production Salesforce environments for clients.

## Components and Features

### Flow Redirect QuickAction (Aura Component)
Hate how there is no out-of-the box solution to redirect a flow to a record? One of my clients did, so I wrote this. The Aura component quickActionRedirectFlow is a simple aura component that can be invoked as a quick action in a flow to redirect a completed flow to an existing record. 

## Usage
